Open Dev Toolkit
======

The Open Development Toolkit is a site bringing together tools and training around development data. It's been forked from [Source](http://source.opennews.org), which has been built with [Django][django], using Mozilla's [Playdoh web app template][gh-playdoh]

Installation
------------

### Requirements

You need Python 2.6 or 2.7, Mozilla's [funfactory][funfactory], MySQL, git, virtualenv, and a Unix-like OS.

[funfactory]: https://github.com/mozilla/funfactory

### Setup

First, make sure you've got funfactory installed, because the Playdoh app template will need it.

`pip install funfactory`

Then:

1. Fork and/or clone this Source repository from GitHub
2. Set up a virtual environment for your new project
3. Activate your virtualenv and cd into the project directory
4. Fetch the submodule dependancies

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

And make sure you have all the development requirements

`pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`

### Configuration

The app has a base settings file that can be found at source/settings/base.py, you can override any of the values there inside a local.py file. 

`cp source/settings/local.py-dist source/settings/local.py`

Please ensure that you create your own SECRET_KEY and HMAC_KEY

You can point your database config to sqlite for quick testing, or if you'd rather use MySQL, you'll need to create a new database. Adjust the DATABASES dict in source/settings/local.py accordingly, and then

`python manage.py syncdb`

The primary content apps are managed by django-south, so next run

`python manage.py migrate articles`
`python manage.py migrate code`
`python manage.py migrate people`

This repository includes a few fixtures with test articles, people, organizations and code records for you to play with. If you'd like to add them, next run

`python manage.py loaddata test_data`
`python manage.py loaddata taggit_test_data`

And then it's time to fire it up!

`python manage.py runserver`

Now you should be able view your dev server at [http://localhost:8000/][localhost]

[localhost]: http://localhost:8000/
